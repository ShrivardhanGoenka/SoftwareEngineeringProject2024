## Lab 2: Use Case Description, Use Case Diagram, Class Diagrams, Sequence Diagrams, and Dialog Maps

### Overview
For this lab, our team discussed the use case descriptions and diagrams which we had submitted in the previous submission. However, we could not think of any new changes to these 2 deliverables due to its comprehensiveness from the first submission. Thus, we went ahead to discuss the class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and dialog maps for the project. 

The Class Diagrams were created to show the relationship between the Entity Classes in the project. We made an additional stereotype diagram to show the relationship between the boundary classes, control classes, and entity classes.

We made a sequence diagram to demonstrate each use case in the project. The sequence diagram show the exact flow of events passing through the boundary, control, and entity classes as well as the actors in the system.

The dialog maps were created to show the flow of the user interface. The dialog maps show the flow of the user interface and the interaction between the user and the system.

### Use Case Description and Use Case Diagram

The use case diagram can be found [here](./Use%20Case%20Diagram.pdf). There is a JPG version also avaialable [here](./Use%20Case%20Diagram%20PNG.jpg)

The use case description can be found [here](./Use%20Case%20Descriptions.pdf)

### Class Diagrams

The Entity Class Diagram can be found [here](./EntityClassDiagram.pdf)

### Stereotype Diagram

The stereotype diagram showing the relationship between the boundary classes, control classes, and entity classes can be found [here](./Stereotype%20Diagram.pdf)

### Sequence Diagrams

A PDF containing all the sequence diagrams can be found [here](./SequenceDiagrams.pdf). However, since the images may be a bit blurry, we have also included the individual sequence diagrams in the `Sequence Diagrams` folder. The folder is located [here](./Sequence%20Diagrams)

### Dialog Maps
