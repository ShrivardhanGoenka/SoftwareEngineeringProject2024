Redefining Transport and Delivery Services in Singapore

## Overview

ProfitPath is a one-of-a-kind community focussed application aimed to revolutionise transportation and delivery services in Singapore. Following the “Carousel” model of buyer and seller which had earlier reshaped retail and the second-hand product market in Singapore, ProfitPath allows users to be both passengers and drivers, enhancing user engagement through a versatile platform. 

One of the key features of ProfitPath is to allow users to earn money by providing transport and delivery services on daily commutes! This idea harmonises with the Smart Nation initiative of the Singapore Government, by not only enabling a “people-centric” model that employs digital technology to improve people’s lives, it also aligns with the Green Nation goal by reducing carbon emissions and thus, Singapore’s carbon footprint as a whole. ProfitPath serves as a catalyst for socio-economic transformation by encouraging innovative approaches to regular commuting and offering people a chance to earn money by helping the community and the environment at large!

ProfitPath also provides an invaluable solution for individual transport and delivery needs. With immediate or scheduled options, users can access cheap and fast transport services or have their goods delivered in a cost-effective manner.
